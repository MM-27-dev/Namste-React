What is Emmet?
Emmet is a productivity tool for web developers that allows you to write HTML and CSS more quickly using abbreviated syntax. For example, typing div>ul>li*3 and pressing Tab expands to a div containing a ul with three li elements.
Difference between a Library and Framework

Library: A collection of reusable functions you call when needed (you're in control of the flow). Example: jQuery.
Framework: A structure where the framework calls your code (inversion of control). Example: Angular.

What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that delivers web content based on geographic location. We use CDNs to:

Improve loading speed by serving content from servers closer to users
Reduce server load by offloading content delivery
Enhance availability and redundancy

Why is React known as React?
React is named for its core purpose: it "reacts" to data changes. Its reactive approach updates the UI automatically when the underlying data changes, rather than requiring manual DOM manipulation.
What is crossorigin in script tag?
The crossorigin attribute in a script tag specifies how the browser handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests. It helps manage security when loading resources from different domains. Values include anonymous (sends requests without credentials) and use-credentials (sends credentials).
What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

React: The core library with components, state management, and reconciliation algorithm
ReactDOM: The rendering layer specific to web browsers that actually manipulates the DOM

What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

react.development.js: Larger file with helpful warnings, error messages, and debugging information. Use during development.
react.production.js: Minified, optimized version without extra warnings. Smaller file size and better performance for production environments.

What is async and defer?
Both are attributes for the script tag that control how JavaScript files load:

async: Script downloads in parallel with HTML parsing and executes as soon as it's available, interrupting parsing

Use for independent scripts that don't rely on page structure


defer: Script downloads in parallel with HTML parsing but executes only after parsing is complete, just before the DOMContentLoaded event

Use for scripts that need the DOM fully built or depend on other scripts in order



In simpler terms:

Default (no attribute): "Stop and wait for me, then continue"
async: "Don't wait for me, I'll run when I'm ready"
defer: "Don't wait for me, I'll run when you're finished"
