# 🌟 Episode 9: Optimizing Our Application 🚀

Welcome to Episode 9 of my React journey! In this episode, we focused on optimizing our application through custom hooks, modular code, and performance enhancements. Let’s dive into the key concepts and learnings! 🌈

## 📚 Key Learnings

### Part 1: Understanding Custom Hooks and Code Modularity 🛠️

- **Custom Hooks**: We learned that hooks can be thought of as utility functions or helper functions that encapsulate reusable logic. They help us maintain clean and organized code.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component or hook should have one responsibility, making our code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Modular Code**: By making our project modular, we achieve:
  - **Reusability**: Code can be reused across different components.
  - **Maintainability**: Easier to update and manage code.
  - **Testability**: Simplifies testing individual components or hooks.
  
  Custom hooks are typically created in a `utils` folder, and we should create a separate file for each hook.

### Part 2: Creating Our Custom Hook 🍽️

- We created a custom hook called `useRestaurantMenu` to fetch restaurant menu data. This hook encapsulates the logic for fetching and managing restaurant information.

```javascript
// Creating our Custom Hook

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { REST_MENU } from "../utils/constants";

const useRestaurantMenu = (resId) => {
    const [resInfo, setResInfo] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchData();
    }, []);

    const fetchData = async () => {
        try {
            const data = await fetch(REST_MENU + resId);
            const json = await data.json();
            setResInfo(json);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
        }
    }

    return resInfo;
}

export default useRestaurantMenu;
```

### Part 3: Implementing Online/Offline Status Feature 🌐

- We created a custom hook called `useOnlineStatus` to track the online/offline status of the application. This feature enhances user experience by providing feedback on connectivity.

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const useOnlineStatus = () => {
    const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        window.addEventListener('offline', () => {
            setIsOnline(false);
        });

        window.addEventListener('online', () => {
            setIsOnline(true);
        });

        // Cleanup event listeners on unmount
        return () => {
            window.removeEventListener('offline', () => setIsOnline(false));
            window.removeEventListener('online', () => setIsOnline(true));
        };
    }, []);

    return isOnline;
}

export default useOnlineStatus;
```

### Part 4: Naming Conventions in React 📛

- We discussed the importance of naming conventions in React:
  - Hook names should start with `use` (e.g., `useEffect`, `useOnlineStatus`).
  - Component names should start with a capital letter (e.g., `UserCard`, `GroceryComponent`).

### Part 5: Enhancing Performance in Large Applications ⚡

- In real-world applications, performance can be a concern due to the large number of components. We explored several optimization techniques:
  - **Chunking**: Breaking down large files into smaller chunks to improve load times.
  - **Dynamic Bundling**: Loading only the necessary code for the current view.
  - **Code Splitting**: Splitting code into separate bundles that can be loaded on demand.

- We created a `GroceryComponent` and implemented lazy loading to optimize our application further.

```javascript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const GroceryComponent = lazy(() => import('./GroceryComponent'));

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to Our Grocery Store!</h1>
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <GroceryComponent />
            </Suspense>
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

In this episode, we learned about custom hooks, the importance of modular code, and various performance optimization techniques. These practices will help us build more efficient and maintainable React applications. Stay tuned for the next episode! 🎈
